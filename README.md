## FAQ

#### Why did you start this project?

Because I thought it was cool

#### The integration algorithm you use is the most basic form of numerical integration. What's so impressive about this project?

Man, not every project you do has to impress Harvard's graduate school admissions office. I did it because it was fun and because I thought the visuals looked nice. 

#### Simon, was that last question just you projecting your insecurities onto faceless viewers who had no intention of trashing your project?

Yeah :/
